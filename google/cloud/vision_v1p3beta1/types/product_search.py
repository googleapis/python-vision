        catalog_name (str):
            The resource name of the catalog to search.

            Format is: ``productSearch/catalogs/CATALOG_NAME``.
        category (google.cloud.vision_v1p3beta1.types.ProductSearchCategory):
            The category to search in. Optional. It is inferred by the
            system if it is not specified. [Deprecated] Use
            ``product_category``.
        product_category (str):
            The product category to search in. Optional. It is inferred
            by the system if it is not specified. Supported values are
            ``bag``, ``shoe``, ``sunglasses``, ``dress``, ``outerwear``,
            ``skirt``, ``top``, ``shorts``, and ``pants``.
        normalized_bounding_poly (google.cloud.vision_v1p3beta1.types.NormalizedBoundingPoly):
            The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the

            will be applied. [Deprecated] Use ``bounding_poly``.

            The bounding polygon around the area of

            specified, system discretion will be applied.
        view (google.cloud.vision_v1p3beta1.types.ProductSearchResultsView):
            Specifies the verbosity of the product search results.
            Optional. Defaults to ``BASIC``.

            The resource name of a
            [ProductSet][google.cloud.vision.v1p3beta1.ProductSet] to be
            searched for similar images.

            Format is:
            ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID``.
        product_categories (Sequence[str]):
            The list of product categories to search in.
            Currently, we only consider the first category,
            and either "homegoods" or "apparel" should be
            specified.
        filter (str):
            The filtering expression. This can be used to
            restrict search results based on Product labels.
            We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
            expressions, where each expression within an OR
            must have the same key.
            For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND
            brand = Google" is acceptable, but not "(color =
            red OR brand = Google)" or "color: red".
